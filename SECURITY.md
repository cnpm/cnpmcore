After the initial reply to your report,
the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it
to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes
    will be released as fast as possible to NPM.
